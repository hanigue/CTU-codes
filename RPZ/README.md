### Description

The labs require you to implement learning and inference algorithms for a variety of classifiers.
Your implementations will be tested with different pattern recognition tasks.
Each week a new assignment is introduced at the beginning of the lab,
and you are expected to complete the task during the submission period.
The discussion at the beginning of the lab session will link the theory
presented in the lectures to the practical task in the weekly assignments.
The remaining time of the lab is devoted to individual interactions between students and teaching assistants.
