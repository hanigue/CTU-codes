## Solution to homework


After few runs finally this nmap command brought up some servers (excluding router) with non-22 ports open:

```
sudo nmap -sS -n -v 192.168.1.0/24 -p- -T5 --min-parallelism 200 --max-rtt-timeout 5 --max-retries 1 --max-scan-delay 0 --min-rate 1000
```

I noticed that if run without verbose flag nmap doesn't report on some ports which took a few hours from me.
The server with non-22 ports was 192.168.1.167. Some of the open ports were 22911, 8752, 13079, 26711.
Most of the returnes ASCII art, one of them also contained token `EuphoricMushroomsFeedAnywhere`, this token was then
requested by service on port 26711. We connected to this service using ncat:

```
ncat 192.168.1.167 26711
```

And upon being prompted for the token all that was needed was send this token as request. Response was the flag.
