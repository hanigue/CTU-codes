### Description

This course builds on the skills developed in introductory statistics courses.
It is practically oriented and gives an introduction to applied statistics.
It mainly aims at multivariate statistical analysis and modelling, i.e., the methods that help to understand, interpret, visualize and model potentially high-dimensional data.
It can be seen as a purely statistical counterpart to machine learning and data mining courses.

### Evaluation

1. Students can get a maximum of 100 points.
2. Up to 50 points can be obtained during the semester, another max. 50 points at the written exam.
3. A minimum of 25 points is required to pass the exam.
4. Points for the work during the semester can be obtained for:
  -  Midterm test (15 points).
  - Solution of tasks assigned at tutorials (35 points).
5. Assignments:
  - There are 4 regular assignments (5 points each) and the final assignment (15 points).
  - A delayed submission is penalized as follows: less than one week 50% penalty, more than one week 100% penalty.
6. Midterm test:
  - Test with topics from the first half of the semester, approx. 45 minutes.

7. Necessary conditions to obtain the credit
  - At least four assignments rated more than zero points (i.e., submitted less than one week after deadline).
  - Attendance - no more than 2 missed tutorials allowed.
  - a minimum 25 points reached for tutorials and midterm test.
